        This is the home page, mother page, landing page, etc for the site. This
        will probably be the first page that most people visit and link to,
        consequently the highest PageRanked page.

            <p>This page has no Javascript and no complex PHP. The file extension 
            is PHP more for conformance than for functionality. The twitchy 
            wooden boards effect is an easy CSS trick. If you want to see how 
            that's done check out the About Page for my <a href="AboutMe1.php">

        <title>The Design</title>
        <content>
            <![CDATA[
            
            <p>I am a sucker for Orange (the color, not the fruit). So the copious 
            amounts of the same (the color, not the fruit) on this page. But I 
            must admit that I have lifted most of the design idea from another
            site. I am not going to reveal from where for avoiding comparisons
            (and the fact that the original looks way better). But, if you do 
            find that site, let me know.</p>
            
            <p>This is the first page of the website that I decided to  optimize for
            mobile viewing. Since, this is the first page of the website, that 
            decision was a no-brainer. Also, once you get the basics in place,
            making the page work with mobile devices doesn't require much 
            ingenuity. One of the basic elements that it does require is the 
            Viewport Meta tag. This tag is read by mobile browsers to determine
            what part of the page to display initially and the zoom-in range.</p>
            
<pre><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; 
    content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes&quot; /&gt; 
</code></pre>            

            <p>The content attribute holds most of the required parameters. The 
            device-width value is a useful attribute to dynamically set the 
            viewport to width of the mobile device. The scale values determine 
            the zoom-in levels. The concept of viewport is covered nicely in
            <a href='https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/usingtheviewport/usingtheviewport.html'>
            Apple's Docmentation on Viewports</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Apart from the viewport, its was also necessary to tweak the 
            style-sheet of the page to cater to smaller screens. This is done 
            using a separate stylesheet added to the page as follows:</p>
            
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;stylesheets/homepage1.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;Screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;stylesheets/mobile/homepage1.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; 
    media=&quot;handheld, only screen and (max-width: 480px), 
            only screen and (max-device-width: 480px)&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
            
            <p>The media='Screen' attribute indicates that the stylesheet is 
            targetted for Desktop and media='handheld' indicates mobile devices.
            But the problem is that most modern mobile browsers won't fall for this
            and will still end up using the Screen stylesheet. To target them, 
            we need to determine the stylesheet depending on teh screen size. The 
            width is specified as 480px because that is the landscape mode width 
            non-Retina display iPhones. But most Android and retina display iPhones
            will work with this resolution just fine. Targetting for mobile devices
            is explained in a no-nonsense way at <a href='http://www.seabreezecomputers.com/tips/mobile-css.htm'>
