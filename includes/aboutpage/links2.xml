            <p>This is a XML driven dynamic page. I use a simple XML document
            to store the list of pages on SERNLabs. This document goes like this:
            </p>
<pre><code>&lt;pages&gt;
    &lt;page&gt;
        &lt;AboutXml&gt;
            homepage1.xml
        &lt;/AboutXml&gt;
    &lt;/page&gt;
    &lt;page&gt;
        &lt;AboutXml&gt;
            aboutme1.xml
        &lt;/AboutXml&gt;
    &lt;/page&gt;
&lt;/pages&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>To read the XMLs, I use 
            <a href='http://php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php'> PHP Simple XML</a>.</p>
<pre><code>$pages = array();
$pageList = simplexml_load_file(&#39;pageList.xml&#39;);

$pageNames = $pageList-&gt;page;

foreach($pageNames as $pageName){
    $pageUrl = &quot;../includes/aboutpage/&quot; . trim($pageName-&gt;AboutXml);
    $pages[] = new Page($pageUrl);
}
</code></pre>            
            <p>I have explained Simple XML in a little more detail on the About Page
            of <a href='PhotoGallery1.php'>SERNLabs' Photo Gallery</a>. But I 
            have used more features of PHP XML on the About Page itself. To 
            see that go to the 
            <a href='AboutPage.php' id='aboutPage'>About Page</a> of any 
            About Page - if you understood what I just said.</p>
            <p>I could easily have stored the page information in a MySQL database.
            In fact, I could end up doing that going forward. But XML was a good way 
            to get this page off the ground quickly.

        <title>The Design</title>
        <content>
            <![CDATA[
            
            <p>I started off with a radically different design for this page.
            That looked something like:</p>
            <img src='images/Links1.jpg' alt='Links 1 Image' class="aboutImg"/>
            <p>But half way through I decided that the layout was too distracting
            and drew attention away from the content. So I decided to use a more
            mellowed look. One that gave more prominence to the links - which 
            after all, are what this page is about.</p>
            <p>I have also included Social Media button links on this page for
            Facebook, Google+ and Twitter. Right now, I have hardly customized them,
            though I would like to that at some point. But 
            all three provide good Tutorials and Code Generators to generate 
            their respective links. You could read more about

            for Google+</a> and 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons">Adding the 
            Tweet button</a> at the Developer sections of each site.
